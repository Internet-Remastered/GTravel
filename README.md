# GTravel

This is a google travel alternative. It is the first project in over 30 google products which we are recreating(including hardware).
The aim is to recreate all I use in the internet myself with little or no third parties(except obviously languages and cloud sometimes)/

This is made using flutter as the frontend and rust as the backend. Try to have fun.

All projects in this repo will be released like actual company products with the end goal of dethroning FAANG to the #opensourcecommunity
